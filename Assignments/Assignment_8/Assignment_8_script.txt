#+ Upload responses to the following as a numbered plaintext document to Canvas:
#1.  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.


#My model 3 was the best fit. We fitted a linear model (estimated using ML) to predict growth_rate with temperature, light, species, humidity and nitrogen (formula: growth_rate ~ temperature + light + species + humidity +nitrogen). The model's explanatory power is substantial (R2 =0.47). The model's intercept, corresponding to temperature = 0,light = 0, species = P.cornucopiae, humidity = High and nitrogen =0, is at 216.05 (95% CI [125.06, 307.04], t(210) = 4.65, p < .001).
#Within this model there were several growth rates that were negative. A negative growth rate isn't possible, so those points are scientifically meaningless.

#2.  In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships?  Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
##Yes,there were several variables that did not have a linear relationship. This site (https://bookdown.org/anshul302/HE902-MGHIHP-Spring2020/LogitTrans.html) discusses that you can handle non-linear data using, quadratic regression modeling. This would be where you make the formula into a quadratic formula so it better fits the data. There are also log transformations you can do to the data. 



#3.  Write the code you would use to model the data found in "/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv" with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
#using excel to find the quadratic function for the model I was able to find a line that accurately fit the curve
df.1 <- read_csv("/Users/rosie/Desktop/Data_Course_KENT/Assignments/Assignment_8/non_linear_relationship.csv")
quadratic <- function(x) {
  return(1.1206 * x^3 - 2.5216798 * x^2 + 4.00871039 * x + 0.41537149)
