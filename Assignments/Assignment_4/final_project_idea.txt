#2.    In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project

  #Diamond Prices can be impacted by various things, such as inflation, carat, etc. I will be examining a data set with 53,943 diamonds which includes the variables, carat, cut, color, clarity, x, y, z, depth, table, and price. The images below give a visual explanation of each variable. 
  #The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions:
     #1. Does the data follow the checks for normality? is the data linear? If so what adjustment needs to be made to proceed?
     # 2.	Are all the variables in this data set important in explaining diamond prices? If, not which variables are important? 
     # 3.	Is there an interaction between diamond clarity and carat weight? 
     # 4.	Does the fitted model explain diamond prices well?
     # 5.	What are the differences in prediction intervals and confidence intervals, for diamonds of different carat weights, with the best cut, least amount of color, and highest amount to clarity?




#3 Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like
    #The data set I used is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enashed/diamond-prices This is where the file will be located
read.csv("./Assignments/Assignment_4/Diamonds_Prices2022.csv", header=TRUE)
    #the data  is in a csv format with categorical and numeric variables. The dataset has the following information: carat size, the cut of the diamond, the clor clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, and z
